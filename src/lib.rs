//! # Async version for ZeroMQ bindings
//!
//! Async-zmq is high-level bindings for [`zmq`] in asynchronous manner which is compatible to **every** async runtime.
//! No need for configuring or tuning features. Just plug in and see how it works!
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Users could simply initialize any socket type with `async_zmq::*` in mind, and then call
//! `bind()` or `connect` depends on your scenario. For example, if someone wants a publish socket,
//! then he could initialize the socket like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let zmq = async_zmq::publish("tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")?.bind();
//! ```
//!
//! If there's context need to be shared between different socket, we can set it during building the socket:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let context = Context::new();
//! let xpub = async_zmq::xpublish("inproc://example")?.with_context(&context).bind();
//! let sub = subscribe("inproc://example")?.with_context(&context).connect()?;
//! ```
//!
//! Since the use case of this crate is mostly for sending/recieving multipart message. So it provides [`Multipart`]
//! which is a type alias for `Vec<Message>` when recieving message on type implemented with `Stream`, and [`MultipartIter`]
//! which is a generic struct make any queue can turn into iterator and then send via type  implemented with `Sink`.
//!
//! To learn more about each socket type usage. See [modules](#modules) below.
